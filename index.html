            They were going full steam ahead in their world tour schedule, fresh off the North American leg of Ode to You and slated to perform in several more cities across Asia and Europe. But after their concert in Pasay, the Philippines, K-pop powerhouse SEVENTEEN canceled the remaining shows in February and March due to the coronavirus pandemic. Despite the change in plans, the 13-member group from South Korea still found ways to bring fans together.”Left & Right” SEVENTEEN’s new title track from the latest album Heng:garae, created the perfect opportunity for a quarantine TikTok dance challenge. With an easy-to-learn chorus routine—choreographed by main dancer Hoshi and members of Team Same, a choreography team SEVENTEEN works with regularly—and a catchy refrain resonant of the Cupid Shuffle, “Left & Right” drew fans from around the world, and a large number of  Kpop artists, to groove along.
